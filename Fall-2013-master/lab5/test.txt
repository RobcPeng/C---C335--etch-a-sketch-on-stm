Robert Peng (rcpeng)


Results:
	I successfully created a make file that compiles two seperate c files together. 

Difficulties:
	I originally had difficulties understanding the problem itself. I asked the AI's alot of questions to get past that point.
	I also had difficulties with char, turns out, it was an and/or mixup.
What I learned:
     To double check boolean statements.
